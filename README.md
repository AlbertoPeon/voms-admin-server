The Virtual Organization Membership Service is a Grid attribute authority which
serves as central repository for VO user authorization information, providing
support for sorting users into group hierarchies, keeping track of their roles
and other attributes in order to issue trusted attribute certificates and
assertions used in the Grid environment for authorization purposes.

The VOMS Admin service is a web application providing tools for administering
the VOMS VO structure. It provides an intuitive web user interface for daily
administration tasks.
